Connect nodes at same level
Last Updated: 14-04-2020
Write a function to connect all the adjacent nodes at the same level in a binary tree. Structure of the given Binary Tree node is like following.
struct node { 
    int data; 
    struct node* left; 
    struct node* right; 
    struct node* nextRight; 
} 
Initially, all the nextRight pointers point to garbage values. Your function should set these pointers to point next right for each node.

Example:

Input Tree
       A
      / \
     B   C
    / \   \
   D   E   F


Output Tree
       A--->NULL
      / \
     B-->C-->NULL
    / \   \
   D-->E-->F-->NULL
Recommended: Please solve it on “PRACTICE” first, before moving on to the solution.
Method 1 (Extend Level Order Traversal or BFS)
Consider the method 2 of Level Order Traversal. The method 2 can easily be extended to connect nodes of same level. We can augment queue entries to contain level of nodes also which is 0 for root, 1 for root’s children and so on. So a queue node will now contain a pointer to a tree node and an integer level. When we enqueue a node, we make sure that correct level value for node is being set in queue. To set nextRight, for every node N, we dequeue the next node from queue, if the level number of next node is same, we set the nextRight of N as address of the dequeued node, otherwise we set nextRight of N as NULL.

We initialize a node Prev which points at the previous node. While traversing the nodes in the same level we keep track of the previous node and point the nextRight pointer to the current node in every iteration.

class Node { 
    int data; 
    Node left, right, nextRight; 
  
    Node(int item) 
    { 
        data = item; 
        left = right = nextRight = null; 
    } 
} 
  
public class BinaryTree { 
    Node root; 
    void connect(Node p) 
    { 
        // initialize queue to hold nodes at same level  
        Queue<Node> q = new LinkedList<>(); 
  
        q.add(root); // adding nodes to tehe queue 
  
        Node temp = null; // initializing prev to null 
        while (!q.isEmpty()) { 
            int n = q.size(); 
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { 
                Node prev = temp; 
                temp = q.poll(); 
  
                // i > 0 because when i is 0 prev points 
                // the last node of previous level,  
                // so we skip it 
                if (i > 0) 
                    prev.nextRight = temp;  
  
                if (temp.left != null) 
                    q.add(temp.left); 
  
                if (temp.right != null) 
                    q.add(temp.right); 
            } 
  
            // pointing last node of the nth level to null 
            temp.nextRight = null;  
        }

        tree.root = new Node(10); 
        tree.root.left = new Node(8); 
        tree.root.right = new Node(2); 
        tree.root.left.left = new Node(3); 
  
        // Populates nextRight pointer in all nodes 
        tree.connect(tree.root); 
  
        // Let us check the values of nextRight pointers 
        System.out.println("Following are populated nextRight pointers in "
                           + "the tree"
                           + "(-1 is printed if there is no nextRight)"); 
        int a = tree.root.nextRight != null ? tree.root.nextRight.data : -1; 
        System.out.println("nextRight of " + tree.root.data + " is "
                           + a); 
        int b = tree.root.left.nextRight != null ? tree.root.left.nextRight.data : -1; 
        System.out.println("nextRight of " + tree.root.left.data + " is "
                           + b); 
        int c = tree.root.right.nextRight != null ? tree.root.right.nextRight.data : -1; 
        System.out.println("nextRight of " + tree.root.right.data + " is "
                           + c); 
        int d = tree.root.left.left.nextRight != null ? tree.root.left.left.nextRight.data : -1; 
        System.out.println("nextRight of " + tree.root.left.left.data + " is "
                           + d); 
    } 
}

Output:
Following are populated nextRight pointers in the tree(-1 is printed if there is no nextRight)
nextRight of 10 is -1
nextRight of 8 is 2
nextRight of 2 is -1
nextRight of 3 is -1
Please refer connect Nodes at same Level (Level Order Traversal) for implementation.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Method 2 (Extend Pre Order Traversal)
This approach works only for Complete Binary Trees. In this method we set nextRight in Pre Order fashion to make sure that the nextRight of parent is set before its children. When we are at node p, we set the nextRight of its left and right children. Since the tree is complete tree, nextRight of p’s left child (p->left->nextRight) will always be p’s right child, and nextRight of p’s right child (p->right->nextRight) will always be left child of p’s nextRight (if p is not the rightmost node at its level). If p is the rightmost node, then nextRight of p’s right child will be NULL.
